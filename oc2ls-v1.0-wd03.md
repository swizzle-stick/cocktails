## Abstract
Cyberattacks are increasingly sophisticated, less expensive to execute, dynamic and automated. The provision of cyberdefense via statically configured products operating in isolation is no longer tenable. Standardized interfaces, protocols and data models will facilitate the integration of the functional blocks within a system or enterprise. Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a concise and extensible language to enable the command and control of cyber defense components, subsystems and/or systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms or other aspects of the implementation. It should be understood that a language such as OpenC2 is necessary but insufficient to enable coordinated cyber response. Other aspects of coordinated cyber response such as sensing, analytics, and selecting appropriate courses of action are beyond the scope of OpenC2.

# 1 Introduction
The OpenC2 Language Specification defines a language used to compose messages for command and control of cyber defense systems and components.

The OpenC2 language defines two message types: 

1. **Command**: An instruction from one system to another to act on the content of the command

2. **Response**: Any information captured or necessary to send back to the invoking system that requested the Command be invoked

The components of an OpenC2 Command are an action (what is to be done), a target (what is being acted upon), an optional actuator (what is performing the command), and command options, which influence how the command is to be performed. An action coupled with a target is sufficient to describe a complete OpenC2 Command. The inclusion of an actuator and/or command-options provide additional precision. 

Additional detail regarding the TARGET and ACTUATOR may be included to increase the precision of the command. For example, which target (i.e., target specifier), additional information about what is to be performed on a specific target type (i.e., target option), which actuator(s) (i.e., actuator specifier) and/or additional information regarding how a specific actuator executes the action (i.e., actuator option).

An OpenC2 Response is issued as a result of an OpenC2 command.  OpenC2 responses are used to provide acknowledgement, status, results of command execution, or other information in conjunction with a particular command.

## 1.1 Goal
> Editor's Note - TBSL - This section will be included in a future iteration (probably iteration 5) prior to submitting for Committee Specification.

## 1.2 Purpose and Scope
The OpenC2 Language Specification defines the set of components to assemble a complete command and control message and provides a framework so that the language can be extended. . To achieve this purpose, the scope of this specification includes:

1. the set of actions and options that may be used in OpenC2 commands
2. the set of targets, target specifiers, and target options
3. A syntax that defines the structure of commands and responses
4. an organizational scheme that describes an Actuator Profile
5. The MTI serialization of OpenC2 commands, and responses
6. the procedures for extending the language 

The OpenC2 language assumes that the event has been detected, a decision to act has been made, the act is warranted, and the initiator and recipient of the commands are authenticated and authorized. The OpenC2 language was designed to be agnostic of the other aspects of cyber defense implementations that realize these assumptions. The following items are beyond the scope of this specification:

1. Language extensions unique to an actuator
2. Alternate serializations of OpenC2 commands
3. The enumeration of the protocols required for transport, information assurance, sensing, analytics and other external dependencies

# 2 OpenC2 Language

## 2.1 Overview
The OpenC2 language has two distinct message types: Command and Response. The OpenC2 Command describes an action performed on a target. The OpenC2 Response is a means to provide information (such as acknowledgement, status, etc.) as a result of an OpenC2 Command.

## 2.2 OpenC2 Command
The OpenC2 Command communicates an action to be performed on a target and may include information identifying the actuator(s) that is to execute the command.

### 2.2.1 Command Structure
An OpenC2 Command has four fields: ACTION, TARGET, ACTUATOR and COMMAND-OPTIONS.

The ACTION and TARGET fields are required and are populated by one of the 'action-types' in Table 2-1 and the 'target-types' in Table 2-2. A particular target-type may be further refined by one or more 'target-specifiers' and/or 'target-options'. 

The optional ACTUATOR field identifies the entity or entities that are tasked to execute the OpenC2 Command.

Information with respect to how the action is to be executed is provided with one or more 'actuator-options'. 

The optional COMMAND-OPTIONS field is populated by one or more 'command-options' that provide information that influences how the command is executed.    

The following list summarizes the fields and subfields of an OpenC2 Command. OpenC2 Commands MUST contain an ACTION and TARGET and MAY contain an ACTUATOR and/or COMMAND-OPTIONS. OpenC2 is agnostic of any particular serialization; however, implementations MUST support JSON serialization of the commands.

* **ACTION** (required): The task or activity to be performed.
* **TARGET** (required): The object of the action. The ACTION is performed on the target.
    * **TARGET-NAME** (required): The name of the object of the action.
    * **TARGET-SPECIFIERS** (optional): The specifier further identifies the target to some level of precision, such as a specific target, a list of targets, or a class of targets.
    * **TARGET-OPTIONS** (optional): Additional information about how to perform the action for a specific target type.
* **ACTUATOR** (optional): The ACTUATOR may perform the ACTION on the TARGET. The ACTUATOR type will be defined within the context of an Actuator Profile.
    * **ACTUATOR-NAME** (required): The name of the set of functions (e.g., "firewall") performed by the actuator, and the name of the profile defining commands applicable to those functions.
    * **ACTUATOR-SPECIFIERS** (optional): The specifier identifies the actuator to some level of precision, such as a specific actuator, a list of actuators, or a group of actuators.
    * **ACTUATOR-OPTIONS** (optional): The options specify how a particular ACTION is to be performed for an actuator type.
* **COMMAND-OPTIONS** (optional): Provide additional information on how the command is to be performed, such as date/time, periodicity, duration etc. COMMAND OPTIONS only influence/ impact the command and are defined independently of any ACTION, ACTUATOR or TARGET.

The TARGET of an OpenC2 Command may include a set of targets of the same type, a range of targets, or a particular target. Specifiers for TARGETs are optional and provide additional precision for the target.

The OpenC2 ACTUATOR field identifies the entity(ies) that execute the ACTION on the TARGET. Specifiers for actuators refine the command so that a particular function, system, class of devices, or specific device can be identified. Actuator-options indicate how an action is to be done in the context of the actuator. 

COMMAND-OPTIONS influence the command by providing information such as time, periodicity, duration, or other details on what is to be executed. They can also be used to convey the need for acknowledgement or additional status information about the execution of a command.

### 2.2.2 Action Vocabulary
This section defines the set of OpenC2 actions grouped by their general activity. Table 2-1 summarizes the definition of the OpenC2 actions.

* _Actions that Control Information_: These actions are used to gather information needed to determine the current state or enhance cyber situational awareness.
* _Actions that Control Access_: These actions are used to control traffic flow and file permissions (e.g., allow/deny).
* _Actions that Control Activities/Devices_: These actions are used to control the state or the activity of a system, a process, a connection, a host, or a device. The actions are used to execute tasks, adjust configurations, set and update parameters, and modify attributes.
* _Effects-Based Actions_: Effects-based actions are at a higher level of abstraction for purposes of communicating a desired impact rather than a command to execute specific tasks. This level of abstraction enables coordinated actions between enclaves, while permitting a local enclave to optimize its workflow for its specific environment. Effects-based action assumes that the recipient enclave has a decision-making capability because effects-based actions typically do not have a one-to-one mapping to the other actions.

**Table 2-1. Summary of Action Definitions**

| Action      | Description                                           |

### 2.2.4 Actuator
An ACTUATOR is an implementation of a cyber defense function that executes the ACTION on the TARGET.  An Actuator Profile is a specification that identifies the subset of ACTIONS, TARGETS and other aspects of this language specification that are mandatory to implement or optional in the context of a particular ACTUATOR.  An Actuator Profile also defines ACTUATOR-SPECIFIERS and ACTUATOR-OPTIONS that are meaningful and possibly unique to the actuator.

An Actuator Profile SHALL be composed in accordance with the framework in section 4.

> Editor's Note - TBSL - More text be included in a future iteration (probably iteration 4) prior to submitting for Committee Specification.

### 2.2.5 Command-Option Vocabulary
COMMAND-OPTIONS influence a command and are independent of the TARGET, ACTUATOR and ACTION itself.   COMMAND-OPTIONS provide additional information to refine how the command is to be performed such as time, periodicity, or duration, or convey the need for status information such as a response is required. The requested status/information will be carried in a RESPONSE.

Table 2-3 lists the valid command-options.

> Editor's Note - TBSL - This table be included in a future iteration (probably iteration 3) prior to submitting for Committee Specification.

# 5 Conformance
OpenC2 is a command and control language that converges (i.e., common 'point of understanding') on a common syntax, and lexicon. Conformant implementations of OpenC2:

 * MUST support OpenC2 commands and responses as defined in this document.
 * MUST implement the actions designated as mandatory in this document.
 * MUST implement the targets designated as mandatory in this document.
 * MAY implement optional targets defined in this document 
* MAY implement actuator specifiers, actuator options, target specifiers and/or target options as specified in one or more Actuator Profiles. 
 * MUST implement JSON serialization of the commands and responses that are consistent with the syntax defined in this document.
